# BTTC NFT Tutorial

Please refer to [Simple NFT Example on BTTC Donau Testnet](https://github.com/BTTC-Developer-Hub/bttc-nft-tutorial) to check how to build, mint, and send around your own ERC721 with BTTC Donau testnet!

# Quick Start
Required: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
Optional: [IPFS][IPFS]

## App Configuration
Open `Terminal` and build the project, please install node in advance
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Jama55/simple-nft-bttc-donau simple-nft-example
```

```
cd simple-nft-example
git checkout simple-nft-example
yarn install
yarn start
```
in a second terminal window, start your frontend
```
cd simple-nft-example
yarn chain
```

in a third terminal window, deploy your contract, use `localhost` as your network
```
cd simple-nft-example
yarn deploy --network NETWORK_OF_CHOICE (localhost, bttc_donau)
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## Config IPFS
If you don't have an Infura IPFS project, please use desktop or command-line version of [**IPFS**][IPFS]. You'll need to edit below scripts to fit your needs.

IPFS API & port -> `packages/react-app/scripts/ipfs.js`
```
const localhost = {
   host: 'localhost',
   port: '5001',
   protocol: 'http',
   path: 'api/v0'
};
```
Mint the token will require uploading to IPFS -> `packages/hardhat/scripts/mint.js`
```
const ipfs = ipfsAPI({
  host: '127.0.0.1', 
  port: '5001', 
  protocol: 'http', 
  path: 'api/v0'
});
```
The frontend's test upload will use IPFS as well -> `packages/react-app/src/App.jsx`
```
const ipfs = ipfsAPI({ 
  host: "localhost", 
  port: "5001", 
  protocol: "http"
 });
 ```
There might be CORS problem，change the config file of IPFS
 ```
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["your whitelist address", "http://localhost:3000", "http://127.0.0.1:5001"]'
ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "POST"]'
 ```
Desktop version please go to `Settings` and change the `IPFS CONFIG` section, don't forget to save and restart the service.

For Infura IPFS project，change the project ID and secret in `mint.js` and `App.jsx`
 ```
const projectId = 'YOUR INFURA PROJECT ID';
const projectSecret = 'YOUR INFURA PROJECT SECRET';
 ```

 ## Mint NFT
 After the IPFS configuration is done, go the the frontend and test upload a file to IPFS, make sure the service is up and running.

Before minting, go the `mint.js` script and change `toAddress` linked in the `localhost:3000`, you could use MetaMask or other wallets. Then we go back to the terminal and start minting NFT.
```
yarn mint
```

After the NFTs are minted, try to send around the token (in congnitive window).

# Deploy the Contract!
## Configuration for BTTC Donau testnet
Let's move from the `localhost` to the real world, take BTTC Donau testnet as an example.

Firtst edit `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js`
```
donau_bttc:{
   url: "https://pre-rpc.bt.io/",
   gasPrice: 300000000000000,
   accounts:{
      mnemonic: mnemonic(),
   },
}
// Change default network，from localhost to BTTC testnet
const defaultNetwork = "donau_bttc";
```

Edit `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` as well
```
donau_bttc: {
   name: "donau_bttc",
   color: "#e8a094",
   chainId: 1029,
   rpcUrl: `https://pre-rpc.bt.io/`,
   faucet: "https://testfaucet.bt.io/#/",
   blockExplorer: "https://testscan.bt.io/",
}
```
Modify `App.jsx` to change the default deloying network
```
const targetNetwork = NETWORKS.donau_bttc; 
```

## Generate Account to Deploy Contract
First run `yarn generate` and get a new address. View account info & QR code with `yarn account`, you'll need to fund this account.

Go to the [**Faucet**][faucet] and get some test BTTs.

![](../../../static/img/nfttutorial-7.png)

Deploy the contract on Donau testnet, if there's any warning related to insufficient gas, please follow the instruction and increase gasPrice or gasLimit.
```
yarn deploy --network bttc_donau
```

Mint NFT
```
yarn mint
```
Go the chain explorer to view your transaction or follow the [**Original tutorial**][simple-nft-example] and ship your app.

# Notes
Inspect the `Debug Contracts` tab to figure out what address is the `owner` of `YourCollectible`?

Edit your deployment script `deploy.js` in `packages/hardhat/scripts`

Edit your smart contract `YourCollectible.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`
