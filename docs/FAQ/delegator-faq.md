# Delegator FAQ

### 1. What is the Staking Dashboard URL?

The staking dashboard URL is https://app.bt.io/staking

### 2. What is the minimum stake amount?

There is no minimum stake amount to delegate. However, you can always start with 1 BTT token.

### 3. How many rewards will I get if I delegate?

On [staking dashboard](https://app.bt.io/staking), please click the staking reward calculator button beside Staking APY to determine your estimates.

### 4. Why does my transaction take so long?

All staking transactions of BTTC happen on Ethereum/TRON/BSC for security reasons.

The time taken to complete a transaction depends on the gas fees that you have allowed and also the network congestion of  mainnet at that point in time. You can always increase the gas fees so that your transaction can be completed soon.

### 5. Which wallets are currently supported?

Currently, only the Metamask and Tronlink extension on the desktop browser are supported. We will be gradually adding support for other wallets.
