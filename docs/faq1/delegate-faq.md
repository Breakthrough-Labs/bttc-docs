## 7. How long does it take to deposit assets to the BitTorrent network？
The BTTC network currently supports cross-chain Ethereum/ TRON/ BSC assets, and it takes 7-8 minutes to deposit assets into the BTTC network.

## 8. How long does it take to withdraw assets from the BitTorrent network？
After the user initiates the withdrawal operation on the BTTC network, the operation information will be synchronized to the main chain immediately. Depending on the network congestion, this usually takes 45 minutes to 3 hours;

After the withdrawal operation information is synchronized to the main chain, the receiving address also needs to withdraw the assets from the contract of the corresponding chain through a signature. Due to its chain nature, the confirmation time is relatively long.
