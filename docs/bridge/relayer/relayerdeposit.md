# Use BTT as Relayer Pledge
Relayers are of great importance on BTTC, especially for cross-chain transfers and asset liquidity. Therefore, pledge plays an indispensable role in ensuring that Relayers perform their duties in accordance with the terms.


## How does pledge work?
To be a Relayer, you need to prepare at least 25,000,000,000 BTT on BTTC Mainnet as pledge. You can transfer your assets from TRON, Ethereum, or BSC to BTTC and get BTT、BTT_e、BTT_b, which can then be used as pledge on BTTC for Relayer application.
The pledge is a guarantee of Relayers’ performance and therefore needs to be reserved on BTTC throughout the Relayer service.

If you want to stop being a Relayer, you can quit anytime and withdraw your pledge after that. The withdrawn pledge will be in BTT and can be converted into BTT_b or BTT_e anytime at a 1:1 ratio for later transfers.

## How will pledge affect my orders?
The higher your pledge is, the more orders you can take.
The amount of your pledge also affects your ranking in the Relayer recommendation list. Relayers with a higher pledge are more likely to be recommended to users. Users also prefer these Relayers for a more secure service.
BTTC also sets a lower limit for pledge. Therefore, your pledge must be equal to or greater than the lower limit if you want to take orders as a Relayer.

## What is the punishment mechanism for Relayers?
As an important part of the network, Relayers must be responsible for the orders. If you fail to complete an order on time, you will be punished and a certain amount of your pledge will be deducted.

Here is how the fine is calculated: Fine = The larger one of [the Relayer service fee of the current transfer] and [the gas fee paid to help use receive asset of the current transfer] * Punishment factor A (which is currently 1.3).
The pledge will be deducted directly through triggering smart contracts on BTTC. When your pledge goes below 5,000,000,000 BTT after deduction, you will not be able to take orders anymore. You need to replenish your pledge to at least 5,000,000,000 BTT to be able to take orders again.

Therefore, as a Relayer, you must perform your duties by completing orders on time. Otherwise, your pledge may be deducted.
