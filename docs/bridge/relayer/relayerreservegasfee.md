# Reserve Gas Fee

## Why do I need to reserve enough tokens for the gas fee?

After you have been approved as a Relayer, you can help users with their cross-chain transfers and earn rewards. During this process, you need to call smart contracts to help users receive their assets, which requires a certain amount of gas. Therefore, you need to reserve enough funds to pay the gas fee on the target chain.
If the transfer fails due to your insufficient funds, your pledge may be deducted, and it may also hurt your order success rate. Relayers with a success rate lower than 60% will not be recommended to users for selection.

 
## How many tokens should I reserve for the gas fee?
We recommend that you reserve at least 50,000 TRX or equivalent resources (Energy & Bandwidth) on TRON, 5 ETH on Ethereum, and 1 BNB on BSC to pay the gas fee.
