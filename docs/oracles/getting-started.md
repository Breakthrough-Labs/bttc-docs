# Getting Started

There is often a need for smart contracts to access contract-related information from the outside world. However, smart contracts cannot obtain external data outside of the blockchain network. To solve this problem, an oracle provides a way for blockchains or smart contracts to interact with external data.

On one hand, the oracle triggers a state change on the blockchain by verifying and submitting real-world event information to the smart contract, on the other hand, it verifies and sends event information on the blockchain to real-world entities. The oracle is the connection path between on-chain and off-chain events, and is the middleware between the real world and smart contracts.
